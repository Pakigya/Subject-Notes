Hub vs Router vs Repeater vs Gateway vs Switch
--------------------------------------------------
Repeater : Physical layer. Do not amplify the signal. Regenerate signal bit by bit to prevent loss or weakning of the signal.
Hub: Multiport Repeater. No intelligence. Eg: Star topology
Bridge : Data link layer. Repeater + Filter contents by reading MAC addresses
Switch : Multi port bridge. Does error checking too.
Router : Network layer
Gateway: Protocol convertor. Can operate at any level
