CHICAGO (AP) â€” Citing high fuel prices, United Airlines said Friday it has increased fares by $6 per round trip on flights to some
cities also served by lower-cost carriers. American Airlines, a unit of AMR, immediately matched the move, spokesman Tim Wagner
said. United, a unit of UAL, said the increase took effect Thursday night and applies to most routes where it competes against
discount carriers, such as Chicago to Dallas and Atlanta and Denver to San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.
