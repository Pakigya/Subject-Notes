Kernel or Mask or Filter : Non uniform weighted matrix
In image processing, a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a small matrix. It is used for blurring, 
sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between a kernel and an image
Smoothing is same as blurring. Helps to reduce noise.
Bigger kernel generally means bigger sigma( variance ).
Convolution : Flips in both directions.
Convolution vs Correlation only matters if we have an asymmetric filter. Otherwise output is same.
Shift Invariant : Operator behaves the same everywhere i.e the value of the output depends on the pattern in the image neighborhood,
not on the position of the neighborhood( eg: left or right or top or bottom).

          0 0 0
Impulse : 0 1 0
          0 0 0
          
Original Image + Impulse : No change( Original image)
Original Image + not centered impulse( 0 0 0   : Shifted left by 1 pixel with correlation
                                       0 0 1
                                       0 0 0)
                                       
Original Image + Box filter( 1 1 1   : Blur image
                             1 1 1 
                             1 1 1 )

If suppose our filter is : 0 0 0    
                           0 2 0  -  Box filter => Sharpened image
                           0 0 0 
Median filter is edge preserving. It is also a non linear filter.

How do we handle noise?
