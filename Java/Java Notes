Naming Convetion : 
Java follows CamelCase naming convention. Naming conventions vary according to different requirements :
1. Classes and Intefaces: Nouns in mixedCase with the first character capitalized and the first letter of every internal word capitalized.
Eg: HelloWorld
2. Methods : Verbs with first letter in small case and the internal first word of every subsequent word capitalized.
Eg: sayHello()
3. Variables : Small case. Cannot start with underscore or dollar sign.
Eg: length
4. Constant Variables : All in uppercase with words separated by underscore.
Eg: STRING_LENGTH
5. Packages : Eg: com.samsung.noida.framework
