Manifest file : Describes the fundamental characteristics of the app and defines each of its components. Eg: permissions,
activity, service, receiver etc.

build.gradle => To configure how the Gradle tools compile and build your app.
MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity

Intent : An Intent is an object that provides runtime binding between separate components, such as two activities. The Intent represents an app’s "intent to do something." 
Activity class is subclass of Context.
An Intent can carry data types as key-value pairs called extras.
Common uses of Intent
-------------------------
1. To start an Activity
2. To start a service
3. To deliver a broadcast

Supporting different languages and cultures : Add support in res folder. Each directory's name should adhere to the following format:
<resource type>-b+<language code>[+<country code>]    Eg: mipmap-b+es+ES for Spain

Supporting different sizes :  four generalized sizes: small, normal, large, xlarge
                              four generalized densities: low (ldpi), medium (mdpi), high (hdpi), extra high (xhdpi)
                              
MyProject/
    res/
        layout/
            main.xml
        layout-large/
            main.xml
Provide bitmap images that are properly scaled.
xhdpi: 2.0
hdpi: 1.5
mdpi: 1.0 (baseline)
ldpi: 0.75
This means that if you generate a 200x200 image for xhdpi devices, you should generate the same resource in 150x150 for hdpi, 
100x100 for mdpi, and 75x75 for ldpi devices.

Fragment : A modular section of an activity, which has its own lifecycle, receives its own input events, and which you can add or 
remove while the activity is running (sort of like a "sub activity" that you can reuse in different activities).
One difference when creating a Fragment is that you must use the onCreateView() callback to define the layout. 
One fragment should never talk directly to another fragment - instead go through the parent activity.
Fragments communicate via Intents.

In short, fragments live inside activities, and each activity can host many fragments. Like activities, they have a specific lifecycle, 
unlike activities, they are not top-level application components. Advantages of fragments include code reuse and modularity 
(e.g., using the same list view in many activities), including the ability to build multi-pane interfaces (mostly useful on tablets). 
The main disadvantage is (some) added complexity. You can generally achieve the same thing with (custom) views in a non-standard and less robust way.

Following are important points about a fragment:

A fragment has its own layout and its own behavior with its own lifecycle callbacks.
You can add or remove fragments in an activity while the activity is running.
You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI.
A fragment can be used in multiple activities.
The fragment life cycle is closely related to the lifecycle of its host activity.
When the activity is paused, all the fragments available in the acivity will also be stopped.
A fragment can implement a behavior that has no user interface component.
Fragments were added to the Android API in Android 3 (Honeycomb) with API version 11.

Eg: Two fragments, displayed in different configurations for the same activity on different screen sizes. On a large screen, 
both fragments fit side by side, but on a handset device, only one fragment fits at a time so the fragments must replace each other as the user navigates.
Views have their own life cycle too.

The main reason to use Fragments are for the backstack and lifecycle features. Eg: Using the back button
Otherwise, custom views are more light weight and simpler to implement

Bundle : Bundle is used to pass data between Activities. You can create a bundle, pass it to Intent that starts the activity which then can be used from the destination activity.
Intent intent = new...
Intent(getApplicationContext(), SecondActivity.class);
intent.putExtra("myKey", AnyValue);  
startActivity(intent);

You can get the passed values by doing:

Bundle extras = intent.getExtras(); 
String tmp = extras.getString("myKey");

Content Providers vs SQLite
-----------------------------
Storing your data in a database is one good way to persist your data, but there's a caveat in Android-databases created in 
Android are visible only to the application that created them. That is to say, a SQLite database created on Android by one 
application is usable only by that application, not by other applications.
So, if you need to share data between applications, you need to use the content provider model as recommended in Android.
The main difference is: when your app needs to share information to another apps, use Content-Provider. SQLite only storage data for the app who creates it

BroadcastReceiver : Receives broadcast. Eg: ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED 

AsyncTask vs Handler
-------------------------
If you are doing something isolated related to UI, for example downloading data to present in a list, go ahead and use AsyncTask.
If you are doing multiple repeated tasks, for example downloading multiple images which are to be displayed in ImageViews
(like downloading thumbnails) upon download, use a task queue with Handler.
Both are internally implemented using Thread of Java.
AsyncTask enables proper and easy use of the UI thread. This class allows you to perform background operations and publish results 
on the UI thread without having to manipulate threads and/or handlers.
AsyncTasks should ideally be used for short operations (a few seconds at the most.) If you need to keep threads running for long 
periods of time, it is highly recommended you use the various APIs provided by the java.util.concurrent package such as Executor, ThreadPoolExecutor and FutureTask.

There are two main uses for a Handler: 
(1) to schedule messages and runnables to be executed as some point in the future; and 
(2) to enqueue an action to be performed on a different thread than your own.

WebViews
-----------
A common scenario in which using WebView is helpful is when you want to provide information in your application that you 
might need to update, such as an end-user agreement or a user guide. Within your Android application, you can create an 
Activity that contains a WebView, then use that to display your document that's hosted online.
Another scenario in which WebView can help is if your application provides data to the user that always requires an Internet 
connection to retrieve data, such as email. In this case, you might find that it's easier to build a WebView in your Android 
application that shows a web page with all the user data, rather than performing a network request, then parsing the data and 
rendering it in an Android layout. Instead, you can design a web page that's tailored for Android devices and then implement a 
WebView in your Android application that loads the web page.

Performance considerations
-------------------------------
1. Making ListView Scrolling Smooth : The key to a smoothly scrolling ListView is to keep the application’s main thread (the UI thread) free from heavy processing. 
Ensure you do any disk access, network access, or SQL access in a separate thread. 
2. Hold View Objects in a View Holder : Your code might call findViewById() frequently during the scrolling of ListView, which can slow 
down performance. Even when the Adapter returns an inflated view for recycling, you still need to look up the elements and update them. 
A way around repeated use of findViewById() is to use the "view holder" design pattern.
A ViewHolder object stores each of the component views inside the tag field of the Layout, so you can immediately access them without 
the need to look them up repeatedly. First, you need to create a class to hold your exact set of views.
3. Delayed Loading of Views  :Sometimes your layout might require complex views that are rarely used. Whether they are item details, 
progress indicators, or undo messages, you can reduce memory usage and speed up rendering by loading the views only when they are needed.
4. Create a Re-usable Layout( define in an xml )
